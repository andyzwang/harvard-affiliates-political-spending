    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Andy Wang, and I'm currently a first-year at Harvard College. I plan on concentrating in Social Studies with a secondary in Computer Science. I'm interested in exploring the ways that people interact with the surroundings around them, in terms of institutions, cultures, people, and spaces.</p>

    <h1>Data Sources</h1>
    <h4>
            <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data">Federal Elections Commission Bulk Data</a>
          </h4>
    <p>I used the 2019-2020 committees bulk data from the FEC in order to match the receipt ID's of Harvard faculty political spending with committees and their names / addresses.</p>
    <h4>
            <a href="https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/how-to-research-public-records/individual-contributions/">Federal Elections Commission Individual Contributions Data</a>
          </h4>
    <p>I used FEC's online Individual Contributer Data tool to conduct a mass search of all individuals who report their employer as "Harvard," filtering for data from 1 January 2017 - 31 December 2020, and recieving contribution information.</p>
    <h4>
            <a href="http://facultyfinder.harvard.edu/search">Harvard Faculty Finder</a>
          </h4>
    <p>I used Harvard's Faculty Finder website to find names, titles, and department affiliations of Harvard faculty members.</p>
    <h4>Individual Harvard Departmental Websites</h4>
    <p>I used individual departmental websites (too many to list here) in order to verify information from the Faculty Finder tool, as well as categorize the race and gender of faculty members based on my best guess.</p>
